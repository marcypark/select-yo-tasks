Chrome extension to add selected text to a to do list!

# installation
[Available on Chrome Web Store!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/edit/oaeaennjegnnoeghgeejhedlmbenjbcb?hl=en-US&authuser=3#)

*OR* 

1. Open Chrome
2. Go to chrome://extensions by typing it into the address bar
3. Check the “Developer mode” box in the upper right corner (and don’t uncheck it until done; otherwise will have to recheck it, click the trash can button next to the extension, and re-upload it)
4. Click “Load unpacked extension…” on the left
5. Select the folder “Select Yo Tasks” within “Marcella Park Final Project”

# usage so far
* Works on any webpage besides Chrome’s default pages, including chrome://extensions and the new tab page – extensions don’t work on those
* Works on any text except text in an iframe (e.g. the Results side of a W3 Schools Tryit Editor)
* Click the browser icon to the right of the address bar to view your to do list
* Select text in the page before clicking the browser icon to add that text to the to do list
* To do list items are also hyperlinks to the pages they were originally selected from ☺
* Tick the checkbox next to a to do list item to delete it
